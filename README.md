# 아빠도 Coupang (Coupang for Dad)

## Introduction
The post-coronavirus era has been all about going virtual. How can we bridge the information gap between generations? We decided to go back to the days of old!

We created a voice-activated ordering service designed for older generations who have difficulty placing orders via touchscreen.

Want food delivered to your doorstep at dawn tomorrow? No app needed. Just give Coupang for Dad "A call"! Older consumers have a lot of purchasing power but are less savvy so Coupang can't reach them without the help others. With Coupang for Dad, we can reach them directly!
